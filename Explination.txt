Explanation:
Header Files:

#include <iostream>
#include <windows.h>
#include <ctime>
These lines include necessary header files for input/output (iostream), Windows-specific functions 
(windows.h for Sleep and Beep), and time-related functions (ctime for getting the current time).

Function Prototypes:

void login();
void deposit_milk();
void menu();
void meal();
void loan();
void about();
These lines declare the prototypes of functions that will be defined later in the code. 
These functions handle different aspects of a milk dairy management system.

Class info:

class info
{
public:
    char name[50];
    int no, fat;
    float milk;
    char day[10];

public:
    void getdata();
    void putdata();
};
This class info is used to store information about a milk deposit, including the customer’s name, 
customer number, milk fat percentage, milk quantity, and whether it’s morning or evening milk. 
It also contains member functions getdata and putdata for inputting and displaying this information.

info Member Function Definitions:
void info::getdata() { ... }
void info::putdata() { ... }
These functions are the implementations of the getdata and putdata member functions of the info class. 
They allow you to input and display customer milk deposit information.

Global Variables:
char user[50];
int pass;
int i, opt;
These are global variables used throughout the program to store the user’s name, password, an 
integer i, and an option opt for menu choices.

main() Function:
int main()
{
    login();
    menu();
}
The main function is the entry point of the program. It calls the login function to authenticate 
the user and then proceeds to the menu function, which displays the main menu.


login() Function:
void login() { ... }
This function handles user authentication by asking for a username and password.
 If the correct password (3003) is entered, it clears the screen, displays a success message, 
 and makes a beeping sound. Otherwise, it shows an error message and recalls main().


deposit_milk() Function:
void deposit_milk() { ... }
This function allows users to deposit milk by choosing whether it’s from a buffalo or cow and 
entering relevant information about the milk deposit. It then displays a bill and asks if the user 
wants to go back to the main menu or continue depositing milk.


menu() Function:
void menu() { ... }
The menu function displays the main menu of options for the user, such as depositing milk, ordering animal meal, 
applying for a loan, viewing information about the dairy, and logging out. It uses a switch statement to handle 
different menu choices.


meal() Function:
void meal() { ... }
This function handles ordering animal meal products. It presents a menu of meal options, calculates the 
total cost based on the quantity selected, and displays a bill. It also allows the user to return to the
main menu or order more meals.

loan() Function:
void loan() { ... }
The loan function handles loan applications. It offers different types of loans (home loan, car loan, 
agriculture loan) with different interest rates. It calculates the total loan amount, interest, and monthly EMI. 
Users can choose a loan type, input loan details, and view their loan receipt.


about() Function:
void about() { ... }
The about function displays information about the SUNITA milk dairy. It provides a brief description of 
the dairy and allows users to return to the main menu by pressing ‘M’.

Code Functions:
1. `void login()`:
– This function handles the user authentication process. 
– It prompts the user for a username and password.
– If the password is correct (3003), it displays a success message with a loading animation and a beep sound.
– If the password is incorrect, it displays an error message and recursively calls itself for the user to retry.

2. `void deposite_milk()`:
– This function allows users to input details about milk deposits.
– Users select the type of animal (buffalo or cow) for which milk is being deposited.
– It creates an instance of the `info` class, gathers input data like name, animal type, milk quantity, 
and fat content.
– It then displays a bill using the `putdata` function of the `info` class and offers an option to 
return to the main menu.

3. `void menu()`:
– This function displays the main menu of the dairy management system.
– It shows options like managing milk deposits, animal meal, loan applications, dairy information, and logout.
– Users input a choice, and based on the choice, the corresponding function is called 
(e.g., `deposite_milk`, `meal`, `loan`, `about`), or the program exits if the user chooses to logout.

4. `void meal()`:
– This function allows users to purchase animal meal products.
– It displays available meal options along with their prices.
– Users choose a product and specify the quantity they want to purchase.
– The function calculates the total cost, displays a bill receipt, and offers an option to return to the main menu.

5. `void loan()`:
– This function provides loan options and calculates loan details.
– It presents loan options like home loan, car loan, and agriculture loan, along with their interest rates.
– Users choose a loan option and input the loan amount and tenure.
– The function calculates interest, total due amount, and monthly EMI. It then displays a loan receipt 
and offers an option to return to the main menu.

6. `void about()`:
– This function displays information about the dairy establishment, benefits, and loan options.
– It provides details about the dairy’s services, benefits for associates, and available loan options.
– Users can choose to return to the main menu or continue reading.

7. `int main()`:
– The main function initializes the program execution.
– It starts by calling the `login` function to authenticate the user.
– If the login is successful, it proceeds to the `menu` function to display the main menu and handle 
user interactions.

These functions collectively create an interactive dairy management system where users can log in, manage 
milk deposits, purchase animal meal, apply for loans, and access information about the dairy. 
The program showcases basic control flow, user input, function calls, and class usage to simulate dairy 
management operations.
